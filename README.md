Project Title
Kura Labs Deployment 1.1
Description
Demonstrate your ability to run a Jenkins build and manually deploy to Elastic Beanstalk.
Issues and Outcomes
This deployment ran much smoother than yesterday. I was able to deploy Jenkins successfully.
 

The main issue that I ran into was with my zipped folders, which is why I wasn’t able to select the “ElasticEC2” option when setting up my Python Shortener on EB per the instructions. 
 What I did to fix this was create a new compressed zip file that included my downloaded files from the GitHub repository. Once I fixed this, I was able to proceed through the instructions and run EB successfully.
 

Installing
•	Downloaded Instructor’s files from GitHub and reuploaded to my GitHub repository. 
•	Created a new zip file
Programs Used
•	Jenkins
•	AWS Elastic Beanstalk
•	GitHub
•	Chat GPT
•	Scribe
Help
I used Chat GPT to help find out why AWS EB had a degraded health status

The main issue that I ran into was with my zipped folders, which is why I wasn’t able to select the “ElasticEC2” option when setting up my Python Shortener on EB per the instructions.

 What I did to fix this was create a new compressed zip file that included my downloaded files from the GitHub repository. Once I fixed this, I was able to proceed through the instructions and run EB successfully.
